# Computer Architecture
- HW1\
Make a basic calculater with RISC-V simulator.
- HW2\
Implement Fibonacci sequence and inorder traversal of a complete binary tree with RISC-V simulator.
- HW3\
Implement a basic single-cycle CPU with verilog.
- lab1\
Extend HW3 to a pipelined CPU. It may `branch`, `stall`, and `forward` as well.
- lab2\
Extend lab1 with a 2-bit dynamic global branch predictor.
